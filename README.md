Retail sales is essential for businesses aiming to make informed, data-driven decisions. It provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends. By analyzing **transactional data, companies can identify peak sales periods, top-performing categories, and shifting customer preferences**. These insights enable businesses to optimize pricing strategies, manage inventory efficiently, and tailor marketing efforts leading to improved **customer satisfaction, increased revenue, and a stronger competitive edge in the market**.

## 📘 Project Overview
This project applies core SQL skills to clean, explore, and analyze retail sales data in a real-world business scenario. It involves designing a structured retail database with tables like customers, orders, products, and transactions. Using SQL functions such as GROUP BY, CASE, and window functions, the data is cleaned and explored to uncover key trends like top-selling products, regional performance, and customer purchase behavior. The analysis identifies business challenges such as low-performing categories or regions and provides insights into customer lifetime value, average order value, and the impact of discounts. Tools like **PostgreSQL along with pgAdmin** are used to run queries. This project demonstrates how SQL can turn raw sales data into meaningful business insights for strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Retail Sales Database Setup** - Design and implement a structured relational database to store **retail transaction data efficiently.**
- **Data Cleaning** - Identify and eliminate records with null or inconsistent values to ensure data quality and reliability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Perform initial data exploration using SQL to understand patterns, trends, and data distribution.
- **Business Insight Generation** - Develop and execute targeted SQL queries to address key business questions, uncover growth opportunities, and support strategic decision-making.

## 🔧 Project Workflow
### 🗄️ 1. Database Configuration
- **Database Deployment** : The project initiates by provisioning a structured database named `Project1`, designed to serve as the centralized repository for all retail transaction data.
- **Schema Definition & Table Structuring** : A comprehensive table, retail_sales, is architected to encapsulate critical sales attributes such as transaction identifiers, timestamps, customer profiles (ID, gender, age), product classifications, quantities sold, pricing metrics, cost of goods sold (COGS), and overall sales figures.

```sql
CREATE TABLE  Retail_sales
(
   transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   sale_date DATE,
   sale_time TIME,
   customer_id INT,
   gender VARCHAR(10),
   age INT,
   category VARCHAR(25),
   quantity INT,
   price_per_unit FLOAT,
   cogs FLOAT,
   total_sale FLOAT

 );
```

### 📊 2. Data Profiling & Preparation
- **Total Records Evaluation**: Calculate the total number of entries in the dataset.

```sql
SELECT
     COUNT(*)
FROM retail_sales;

```

- **Distinct Customer Identification**: Determine the count of unique customers represented in the sales data.

```sql
SELECT
     COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM retail_sales;

```

- **Product Category Enumeration**: Extract and list all distinct product categories found in the dataset.

```sql
SELECT
     DISTINCT category
FROM retail_sales;  

```

- **Missing Data Handling**: Inspect the dataset for any null or incomplete values and remove any records that may compromise data integrity.

```sql

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id is null
    or
    sale_date is null
    or
    sale_time is null
    or
    customer_id is null
    or 
    gender is null
    or
    age is null
    or
    category is null
    or 
    quantity is null 
    or
    price_per_unit is null
    or
    cogs is null
    or 
    total_sale is null;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE
    transactions_id is null
    or
    sale_date is null
    or
    sale_time is null
    or
    customer_id is null
    or 
    gender is null
    or
    age is null
    or
    category is null
    or 
    quantity is null 
    or
    price_per_unit is null
    or
    cogs is null
    or 
    total_sale is null;

```

### 🔍 3. Data Exploration & Key Outcomes
